        <p>
            My name is Spencer Newirth. Currently, I’m studying at Syracuse University and working towards a dual degree in <strong> Applied Data Analytics </strong> and <strong>Television, Radio & Film. </strong> I would love to work on analytics, planning, and production in the world of TV and Film. I’m experienced in numerous coding languages, such as R, SQL, Python,and Java. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To put it briefly, I’m a big nerd. I’m knowledgeable on a ridiculous amount of television, film, and animation history - if there's a series you can mention, I’m probably a fan of it - or at the very least, well-acquainted with it. I make sure to head out to the movies as much as I can! 
        </p>

            I've been trying to get into costume-making and prop production as a little side hobby.
