        <p>
            I am currently studying for an undergraduate degree at Syracuse University with a dual major in Public Communications and Information Studies. 
            I'm working towrds mastering television and film production skills, financial management, and principles and practices of the entertainment industry. To supplement my love for the media world, I've been mastering a slew of coding languages focused on the world of data analysis and data management. 
            Within both majors, I have developed strong project management skills and learnt how to properly lead information-based organizations.

            <p>
                I'm always looking to broaden my vision. I have a deep, long-time passion for the entertainment industry.
                Coming from a background with a love for theater, I am captivated by the production world of movies and television.
                For the longest time, inspired by great cinematic artists, I have wanted to use my insight to create film experiences of my own.
                Of course, this is a difficult pursuit and not one that can be accomplished alone most of the time. 
                While at Syracuse University, I've been mastering television and film production skills, principles and practices of the entertainment industry, and financial management in the film and TV industry.

                I've always been very analytical. Since my youth, I've had a fascination and passion for coding. Data Analytics provides me with a background of technical knowledge that allows me to support
                what I want to do in the world of entertainment. It supplies me with mathematical problem solving skills and project analysis or management skills that can be incredibly useful in the world of entertainment prouction. 
                At Syracuse University, I focused on mastering several coding languages and data analysis / management softwares. I've participated in many large team projects and independent work relating to data inquiry and managing information-based organizations.
