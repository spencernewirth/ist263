    <body>
        My name is Spencer Newirth. Currently, I’m studying at Syracuse University and working towards a dual degree in Applied Data Analytics and Television, Radio & Film. I would love to work on analytics, planning, and production in the world of TV and Film. I’m experienced in numerous coding languages, such as R, SQL, Python,and Java. To put it briefly, I’m a big nerd. I’m knowledgeable on a ridiculous amount of television, film, animation and anime history - if there's a series you can mention, I’m probably a fan of it - or at the very least, well-acquainted with it. I make sure to head out to the movies as much as I can!
